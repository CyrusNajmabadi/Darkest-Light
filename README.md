# Mystic-Light-CLI-Disabler

I wanted a software to simply disable Mystic Light on execute, and then re-enable it back instead of navigating original application.

#### Use-case:

Disable all RGB-fancy-stuff, watch movie in the darkness, re-enable back :D

#### Why this silent change on app execution without anything else:

Well, I've bound it to additional key @ my razer keyboard, so, I have 1 button toggle-switch for RGB, exactly what I wanted!
